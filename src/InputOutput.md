### Literals
Programming languages allow you to "hardcode" (set values/text from
the program) without the use of variables. These are known as `literals`

You can print literals and variables to the screen similarly. Also
when you `assign` values to variables using the `assignment operator (=)`,
you use literals to tell the computer what values they should store

We'll talk about printing data to the screen soon
