# General Format of C++ Code

## what I am going to go over
- `#include`
- `std::`
- `using namespace std;`
- `cout << endl`
- `main function`
- `general formatting of code`

Source files can be overwhelming to start working in. This section is 
dedicated to clarifying and giving more context to the various keywords
and formatting features of the language.

Let's take a look at some basic code - this is generated by my IDE (Integrated
Development Environment) whenever I create a new project in Clion.
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    
    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Running this code as is, gives us the result:
```
Hello World
```
This is a hello world program. As you can see, it prints "Hello World" to
the console. This is a pretty typical first project among new programmers.
If you are already familiar with code, this is probably nothing new. Lets
break down the code itself line by line, starting with the `#include`
---

```c++
#include <iostream>
```
Before we can talk about the # (hash/pound) include, we need to have an idea
of what iostream is. `iostream` is a really large file filled with code that
allow us to take in input and print out data to the screen. `std::cout` for
example is defined in iostream and if we do not have this line, we cannot use
cout.

`#include` is a preprocessor directive. When the compiler begins
compiling, any lines with `#` are looked at and run first (before actual
code). `#include` is a essentially a big copy and paste instruction. When
we #include iostream, what we are doing is copying the contents of the iostream
file and pasting it where the #include directive is in our current file.

We will talk more about files later - and learn to use `#include` with our own
files.

```c++
int main () {
    
    return 0;
}
```
This is what is known as your main function. This becomes our main application
and when called by the operating system, runs our code.
